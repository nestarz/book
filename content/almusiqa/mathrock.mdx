This record is so incredibly versatile, while always keeping this flexibility, the album swims from the incredibly dense drums and double melodies of something like jazz, to the minimalist simplicity of more accessible avant-garde rock.
The use of very light vocal sampling and on set vocals that are especially visceral creates a unique relation to the album, making the listener realize that this is a group of friends rocking out and having fun. by bentoou.
